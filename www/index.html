              <p><strong>YOUR SCORE ON QUESTION #1:</strong> <br>
                The Ninth of the Ten Commandments is "You     shall not lie." Telling just one lie, according     to God's standards, makes you a "liar."     In Revelation 21:8, God says, "...<em>all</em> liars, shall have their part in the lake of     fire..."</p>

                The Seventh of the Ten Commandments is "You     shall not commit adultery." If you've ever     looked at another person with lustful thoughts,     according to God's standards, that makes you     an "adulterer." Jesus said, "You     have heard it said, You shall not commit adultery:     But I say to you, that whoever <em>looks</em> on a woman to <em>lust</em> after her <em>has     committed adultery with her already in his heart</em>."     (Matthew 5:28) In 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, God     says that no adulterers "...shall inherit     the kingdom of God."</p>

                The Third of the Ten Commandments is "You     shall not take the name of the Lord in vain."     If you've every used the name "God,"     "Jesus," or "Christ" as     a curse word, what you've done is take the name     of the God who gave you life, and you've used     it as if it were a "four-letter" filth     word to express disgust. That offense is called     "blasphemy," and according to God's     standards, you are a "blasphemer."     In Leviticus 24:16 , God says, "he that     blasphemes the name of the LORD, shall surely     be put to death..."</p>

              <p><strong>YOUR SCORE ON QUESTION #4:</strong> <br>
                The Eighth of the Ten Commandments is "You     shall not steal." Stealing just one thing     (regardless of it's size or monetary value),     according to God's standards, makes you a "thief."     In 1 Corinthians 6:10, God says, "No thieves...     ...shall inherit the kingdom of God."</p>

              <p><strong>YOUR SCORE ON QUESTION #8:</strong> <br>
                The First of the Ten Commandments is "You     shall have no other gods before me." That     means that we should love God with all of our     heart, mind, soul and strength. The Bible tells     us that <em>no one</em> has kept this commandment     (see Psalm 14:2-3) -- if you said you had, you     have also broken the 9th Commandment by lying.</p>
            </li>

              3. Have you gone to church regularly?<br>

            <li>
              <p><strong>YOUR SCORE ON QUESTIONS #2, #3, and     #6:</strong> <br>
                Giving money to charity, going to church, and     reading the Bible are all good activities--but     none of them impress God. The Bible says, "and <em>all</em> our righteous acts are like filthy     rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like     the wind our sins sweep us away." (Isaiah     64:6) That means, all our "righteous acts"     -- these "good deeds" that questions     2, 3 and 6 asked about -- can <em>never</em> make up for the fact that we've broken God's     Holy Commandments. Think of it this way. If     a person was guilty of a serious crime... such     as murder... but he gave money to charity, does     that make up for his crime? No. The person's     crime hasn't been paid for because he gave money     to charity. This "good deed" will     mean nothing to the judge when he passes sentence.     The murder must still be punished. </p>

            before a judge, guilty of multiple crimes. The 
            judge is about to pass sentence when he asks, 
            "Do you have anything to say for yourself?" </h3>
          <p>You stand up, look the judge in the eye and say, 
            "Yes Your Honor, I believe that you're a 
            good man... and because you're good, you will 
            let me go." The judge will probably say something 
            like, "Well, you're right about one thing... 
            I am a good man. And it's because I'm good that 
            I'm going to see that you are punished for your 
            crimes." The very thing you are counting 
            on to save you on the Day of Judgment -- namely 
            God's goodness -- is going to be the very thing 
            that will see to it that justice is done. Because 
            God is <em>so good</em> He will make sure that 
            every murderer, rapist and thief receives justice... 
            but He won't stop there. He will also make sure 
            every liar, blasphemer, and adulterer is punished. 
            While this is something that is extremely tragic 
            and far from God's ultimate desire for any person, 
            the Bible is clear that the place of punishment 
            for those who do not turn from their sins is Hell.</p>

          <h2>The Bible  Describes <font color="#FF0000">Hell</font></h2>
          <h3>There are three words translated "Hell" in Scripture:<br>
            <em>Gehenna</em> (Greek): The place of punishment (<a href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/bible?language=english&amp;version=KJV&amp;passage=matthew+5:22,29;+10:28" class="popup">Matthew

            11:23; 16:18</a>; <a href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/bible?language=english&amp;version=KJV&amp;passage=luke+16:23" class="popup">Luke 
            16:23</a>; <a href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/bible?language=english&amp;version=KJV&amp;passage=acts+2:27" class="popup">Acts 
            2:27</a>)<br>
            <em>Sheol</em> (Hebrew): The grave (<a href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/bible?language=english&amp;version=KJV&amp;passage=psalm+9:17;+16:10" class="popup">Psalm 
            9:17; 16:10</a>)</h3>
          <p>There are those who accept that Hell is a place of 
            punishment, but believe that the punishment is to be 
            annihilated--to cease conscious existence. They 
            can't conceive that the punishment of the wicked 
            will be conscious and eternal. If they are correct, 
            then a man like Adolph Hitler, who was responsible for 
            the deaths of millions, is being "punished" 
            merely with eternal sleep. His fate is simply to return 
            to the non-existent state he was in before he was born, 
            where he doesn't even know that he is being punished.</p>
          <p>However, Scripture paints a different story. The rich 
            man who found himself in Hell (<a href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/bible?language=english&amp;version=KJV&amp;passage=luke+16:19-31" class="popup">Luke 
            16:19-31</a>) was conscious. He was able to feel pain, 
            to thirst, and to experience remorse. He wasn't 
            asleep in the grave; he was in a place of "torment." 
            If Hell is a place of knowing nothing or a reference 
            to the grave into which we go at death, Jesus' 
            statements about Hell make no sense. He said that if 
            your hand, foot, or eye causes you to sin, it would 
            be better to remove it than to "go into Hell, 
            into the fire that never shall be quenched: where their 
            worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched" (<a href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/bible?language=english&amp;version=KJV&amp;passage=mark+9:43-48" class="popup">Mark 
            9:43-48</a>).</p>
          <p>The Bible refers to the fate of the unsaved with such 
            fearful words as the following:</p>
          <ul>

            ever and ever: and they have no rest day or night."</p>
          <p>We do not enjoy speaking in detail about the torments

          <h2>What God did...</h2>
          <h3>Think of it this way... Imagine you're in a 
            courtroom again, you're guilty of many serious 
            crimes. The judge says, "It's a fine of $500,000, 
            or prison." You don't have anywhere near 
            that amount of money, so the bailiff begins to 
            walk you out of the courtroom when someone you 
            don't even know appears. He runs up to the judge 
            with a check and says, "I've paid the fine 
            for you." Now that the fine has been paid, 
            the law no longer has any hold on you. You're 
            free -- because of the gift you were given.</h3>
          <p><strong>This is what God did for you by sending Jesus 
            to die on the cross in your place. So that you 
            wouldn't have to go to Hell, God sent his only 
            Son, Jesus, to die on the cross -- suffering the 
            punishment that justice demands.</strong> Then He rose 
            from the grave, forever defeating death! The Bible 
            tells us, "For God so loved the world, that 
            He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever 
            believeth on Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting 
            life." (John 3:16) If you will repent of 
            your sins and put your trust in Jesus, God says 
            he will forgive all your sins and grant you the 
            gift of everlasting life. Just like the court 
            case we just talked about, if you repent (that 
            means to confess and forsake your sins) and put 
            your trust in Jesus, then you will not have to 
            suffer God's justice in Hell because the payment 
            for your crimes was made by Jesus on the cross.</p>
          <p>If you're not sure what to pray, read <a href="#psalm51">Psalm 
            51</a>, and make it a model for your prayer. The 
            words are not "magical," what God cares 
            about is the attitude of your heart. When you 
            pray, it should sound something like this, "Dear 
            God, I repent of all my sins, such as (name them). 
            I put my trust in Jesus Christ as Lord (to say 
            Jesus is your Lord means you are now making Jesus 
            the master over your life) and Savior. Forgive 
            me and grant me your gift of everlasting life. 
            In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."</p>

          <h2>Psalm 51:1-17</h2>
          <h3>King David's Prayer of Repentance</h3>
          <p>1. Have mercy upon me, O God, 
            According to Your lovingkindness; 
            According to the multitude of Your tender mercies, 
            Blot out my transgressions.</p>
          <p>2. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, 
            And cleanse me from my sin.</p>
          <p>3. For I acknowledge my transgressions, 
            And my sin is always before me.</p>
          <p>4. Against You, You only, have I sinned, 
            And done this evil in Your sight-- 
            That You may be found just when You speak,
            And blameless when You judge.</p>
          <p>5. Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, 
            And in sin my mother conceived me.</p>
          <p>6. Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts, 
            And in the hidden part You will make me to know wisdom.</p>
          <p>7. Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; 
            Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
          <p>8. Make me hear joy and gladness, 
            That the bones You have broken may rejoice.</p>
          <p>9. Hide Your face from my sins, 
            And blot out all my iniquities.</p>
          <p>10. Create in me a clean heart, O God, 
            And renew a steadfast spirit within me.</p>
          <p>11. Do not cast me away from Your presence, 
            And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.</p>
          <p>12. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, 
            And uphold me by Your generous Spirit.</p>
          <p>13. Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, 
            And sinners shall be converted to You.</p>
          <p>14. Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, 
            The God of my salvation, 
            And my tongue shall sing aloud of Your righteousness.</p>
          <p>15. O Lord, open my lips, 
            And my mouth shall show forth Your praise.</p>
          <p>16. For You do not desire sacrifice, or else I would give it; 
            You do not delight in burnt offering.</p>
          <p>17. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, 
            A broken and a contrite heart-- 
            These, O God, You will not despise.</p>

          <h2>Save Yourself Some Pain</h2>
          <h3>Becoming a Christian is the most incredible event that will ever take place in your life. You have found peace with your Creator. You have found everlasting life! Be assured--God will never leave you nor forsake you. He has brought you this far and He will complete the wonderful work He has begun in you. God knows your every thought, your every care and your deepest concerns.</h3>
          <p>Let's now look at some of those possible concerns. First, and of primary concern -- do you have "assurance" of your salvation? The Bible says to "make your calling and election sure" (<a href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&search=2%20Peter%201.10" data-reference="2 Peter 1.10" data-version="nasb95" class="popup">2 Peter 1:10</a>), so, let's go through a short "checklist" to make sure that you are truly saved:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Are you aware that God became flesh in the person of Jesus Christ (<a href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&search=John%201.14" data-reference="John 1.14" data-version="kjv1900" class="popup">John 1:14</a>), and that he died for the sins of the world?</li>
            <li>Did you come to the Savior because you had sinned?</li>
            <li>Did you "repent" and put your faith in Jesus?</li>
            <li>Are you convinced that He suffered and died on the Cross and that He rose again on the third day?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>God acquits us from the Courtroom of Eternal Justice on the grounds that Jesus Christ paid our fine. We are "justified" (made right with God) by His suffering death. The resurrection of Jesus Christ was God's seal of approval of the fact that His precious blood was sufficient to pay the fine.</p>
          <p>Think of it this way... You have violated the law and face a $50,000 fine. You tell the judge that you are truly sorry for your crime, but he answers, "So you should be -- you have broken the law! Now, can you pay this fine?" He can only acquit you if the fine is paid. If someone else pays your fine, then he can let you go, but he must have "grounds" on which to release you.</p>
          <p>The reason we need a substitute (a savior) to pay our moral "fine," is because we have broken God's Law. To see how much we have transgressed this Law (the Ten Commandments), we will go through some of them -- Have you ever told a lie? Have you ever stolen something? Have you ever lusted after another person? If you answered "Yes" to these questions, you admit that you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart, and you have to face God on Judgment Day! If you have used His name in vain, then you are guilty of "blasphemy" -- you've substituted God's holy Name for a curse word. Perhaps you've hated someone, then the Bible says that you are a murderer. You have violated God's holy Law, and you're in BIG trouble. On Judgment Day, you will be found guilty and end up in Hell. That's why you need the Savior. Merely being sorry for your sins, or confessing them to God won't help you. You must turn from sin (repent), and your faith must be in Jesus Christ alone. He is the only "grounds" for God to grant mercy towards you. If you're not sure of your salvation, make Psalm 51 your own prayer.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at some more important principles that can save you a great deal of pain...</p>
          <h2><a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/daily-bible-reading" class="popup">Daily Bible Reading</a></h2>
          A healthy baby has a healthy appetite. If you have truly been "born" of the Spirit of God, you will have a healthy appetite. The Bible says, "As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby," (<a href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&search=1%20Peter%202.2" data-reference="1 Peter 2.2" data-version="nasb95" class="popup">1 Peter 2:2</a>). Feed yourself every day without fail.<br>
          <br>
          <h2><a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/faith" class="popup">Faith</a></h2>
          When a young man once looked at me and said, "I find it hard to believe some of the things in the Bible," I smiled and asked, "What's your name?" When he said, "Paul," I casually answered, "I don't believe you." He looked at me questioningly.<br>
          <br>
          <h2><a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/evangelism" class="popup">Evangelism</a></h2>
          It was late in December, 1996. A large family gathered in Los Angeles for the joyous occasion of wrapping Christmas presents. It was a big family because it was the product of two marriages.<br>
          <br>
          <h2><a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/prayer" class="popup">Prayer</a></h2>
          It has been well said that God always answers prayer. Sometimes He says, "Yes." sometimes He says, "NO." Sometimes He says, "Wait for a minute," and a day to the Lord is a thousand years to us (<a href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&search=2%20Peter%203.8" data-reference="2 Peter 3.8" data-version="nasb95" class="popup">2 Peter 3:8</a>). That means that a ten year wait for us, is 14 minutes and 24 seconds to God, so ask in faith, but rest in peace-filled patience.<br>
          <br>
          <h2><a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/spiritual-warfare" class="popup">Spiritual Warfare</a></h2>
          When you became a Christian, you stepped right into the heat of an age-old battle. You have a three-fold enemy--the world, the flesh, and the devil.<br>
          <br>
          <h2><a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/fellowship" class="popup">Fellowship</a></h2>
          Pray about where you should fellowship. Make sure the place you are going to call your church home calls sin what it is -- sin. Do they believe the promises of God? Are they loving? Does the pastor treat his wife with respect? Is he a man of the Word? Does he have a humble heart, and a gentle spirit? <br>
          <br>
          <h2><a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/giving-thanks" class="popup">Giving Thanks</a></h2>
          For the Christian, every day should be Thanksgiving Day. We should even be thankful in the midst of problems.<br>
          <br>
          <h2><a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/water-baptism" class="popup">Water Baptism</a></h2>
          The Bible Says , "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins..." (<a href="http://mobile.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=ESV&search=Acts%202.38" data-reference="Acts 2.38" data-version="nasb95" class="popup">Acts 2:38</a>). There is therefore no question as to whether or not you should be baptized. The questions are how, when, and by whom?<br>
          <br>
          <h2><a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/giving-to-god" class="popup">Giving to God</a></h2>
          It was once said that the wallet is the "last frontier"-- that it's the last thing that comes to God in surrender. But it should be the first, along with our surrendered heart.<br>
          <br>
          <h2><a href="http://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/troubleshoot" class="popup">Troubleshoot</a></h2>
          If you know the Lord, nothing will shake your faith. It is true that the man with an experience is not at the mercy of a man with an argument. Take for example a little boy who is looking at a heater. His father warns him that it's hot.
